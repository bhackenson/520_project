# MUS(AI)C

## Introduction

Mus(ai)c is an AI-powered music application where users can create projects and input chord progressions, and the AI will generate a melody over it, allowing users to explore their musical ideas and compositions!

## Install

Due to Mus(ai)c's nature as a web-app, since we are not currently hosting you can run a locally hosted version by cloning this repo, navigating to "frontend-svelte", and then execute `npm i`. Once everything is installed, execute `npm run dev`.

After doing that, then open a new terminal and cd into the server folder and run 'python app.py'. Also in the server, make a new file called db.json with empty curly braces.
